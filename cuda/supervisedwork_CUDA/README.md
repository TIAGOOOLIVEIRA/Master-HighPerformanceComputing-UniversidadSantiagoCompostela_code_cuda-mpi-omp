Supervised Work
2024-2025
Programming Heterogeneous Architectures
Master of High Performance Computing

In this supervised work each student must study one update provided by NVIDIA
in one of the last CUDA updates (8.0 or higher) and write a report about it. This
work will be performed individually and consists of the following steps:

Choose the target CUDA update for your work. You can use one of the updates
introduced in Theme 5 or other update that you know. The new update
must be a novelty in CUDA 8.0 or higher. The analysis of the performance
improvement in some CUDA libraries is also valid, but the students should
explain how this improvement is achieved and not limit the report to show
graphs about the performance increase.

Write a report that technically explains the update and also includes results
about its performance impact. The page limit for this report is 10 pages in
single column and letter size 10pt. The deadline to submit the report to
AulaCESGA is December 22nd 2024. This report is expected to have at
least the following sections:


-Introduction, where the benefit and need of the CUDA update is contextualized.
-Description, where the CUDA update is technically explained. 
-Results and conclusions, which can be either obtained by you (executing some benchmarks on the Finis Terrae 3 supercomputer) or can be taken from websites or other reports.
-Bibliograph
```
