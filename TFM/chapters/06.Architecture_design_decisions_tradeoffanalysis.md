Modular components is a key best practice for High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS), contributing to improved operational efficiency and reduced manual intervention. This approach is crucial for managing complex applications and facilitating continuous development practices in the cloud environment.


## Data centric - Data backbone

Trend in the cloud industry to ties easily integration between different processing engines and capabilities to simplify specially data exchange for one to feed another: HPC <-> AI.

### Storage - Data Structure and Format

###TODO design decisions from "massive..." for the structure, software artifacts, paragraphs, small objectives, scope/non scope, toolings, references where industry already have gone
###TODO metrics to evaluate, graphs, reports, diagrams



**Benefits of Modular Architectures in HPC on AWS**

- Enhanced Scalability and Flexibility: Modular design, as facilitated by cloud services and frameworks like Ray, allows for dynamic scaling of resources (e.g., EC2 instances, GPUs) to meet varying workload demands, moving beyond the limitations of on-premises fixed capacities
- Faster Innovation and Experimentation: Breaking down complex problems into modular components enables quicker experimentation and iteration on business use cases, accelerating the design, development, and testing of new products
- Improved Maintainability and Adaptability: Modular components are easier to update, debug, and maintain. This also allows for the adaptive allocation of compute resources and smoother integration into existing workflows
- Reduced Vendor Lock-in: By designing with modular, open-source frameworks like Ray that integrate with various backends and cloud providers, organizations can reduce dependency on a single vendor's proprietary solutions
