# Optimizing Vector Algorithm Processing through the integration of Ray IO and HPC in the Cloud

## Abstract
The objectives of this study are integrate Ray ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) stack that bridges AI-driven feature engineering with on-demand virtual HPC (High Performance Computing) provisioned with AWS ParallelCluster for boosting developer productivity and assess its architectural quality attributes from a DNA sequencing task context end-to-end processing perspective.

## Introduction
The rapid rise of large scale AI — whether in natural language models or computer vision — hinges on turning raw knowledge (text, images, video) into dense numeric arrays (embeddings) that downstream algorithms can process efficiently. Tokenization and embedding pipelines must handle terabytes — or even petabytes — of data, extract meaningful features, and expose them as vectors for similarity search, graph traversal, or predictive modeling. Traditional frameworks like Apache Spark often fall short at this scale, driving demand for natively distributed, heterogeneous-aware solutions.

## Objectives
- 1. Design and evaluate Ray as a modular orchestration layer based on Ray for ETL and ML (Machine Learning) pipelines on AWS, including autoscaling EC2 to feed an HPC cluster provisioned with AWS ParallelCluster.

- 2. Develop end-to-end application for data transfer based on S3 or FSx-Lustre, Ray tasks for preprocessing with encoding-decoding and feeding a virtual HPC cluster provisioned with AWS ParallelCluster in order to execute tasks within the context of a DNA simulation algorithm.

- 3. Benchmark heterogeneous application pipeline and hardware for an architecture trade-off analysis.


## Context and Motivation

Building on the introduction’s emphasis on transforming vast, raw datasets into high dimensional embeddings, we now turn to how those vectors are consumed and refined by specialized hardware. Modern CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs each excel at different numerical tasks, from wide vector matrix multiplies to sparse graph traversals or custom accelerator kernels. However, unlocking this heterogeneous performance demands a unifying, cloud agnostic control plane. Ray’s lightweight task and actor abstractions — tightly integrated with AWS services — provide exactly that: seamless CI/CD and IaC for both AI/ML preprocessing and traditional HPC workloads.

By automating the entire data lifecycle — ingesting raw reads into S3 or FSx-Lustre, sharding, vectorizing and extracting embeddings from them with Ray, dispatching compute intensive simulations on ParallelCluster, and then feeding results back into downstream ML or analytics workflows — this proposal establishes an **iterative feedback loop**. This cyclical pattern ensures that insights from each phase continuously enrich the next, delivering a fully interoperable, scalable pipeline that maximizes both performance and cost efficiency for next generation AI driven and HPC powered applications.
