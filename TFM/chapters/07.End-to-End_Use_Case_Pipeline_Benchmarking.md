In a protein-sequencing context, data must be prepared the to upstream for simulation tasks. 

Embedding extraction: Ray tasks invokes the ML model ProtBERT on each frame or on static structures to compute residue embeddings—stored as (N_res × D) float arrays.

HPC integration: Stage these embedding arrays to S3/FSx, then submit gmx mdrun or custom MPI-accelerated analysis kernels on a ParallelCluster, passing embedding file URIs for co-analysis.

By treating each GROMACS input step as its own modular component—with clear parsing, transformation, cleaning, and serialization the workflow also benefits by:
    Automate reproducible pipelines (CI/CD for MD setups)
    Scale data prep via Ray’s parallel I/O and task scheduling
    Interoperate with HPC kernels that consume numeric embeddings rather than raw PDB text
