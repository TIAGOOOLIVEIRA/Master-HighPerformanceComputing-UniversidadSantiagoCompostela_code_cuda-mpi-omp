# Optimizing Vector Algorithm Processing through the integration of Ray IO and HPC in the Cloud

## Abstract
The objectives of this study are integrate Ray ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) stack that bridges AI-driven feature engineering with HPC (High Performance Computing) AWS ParallelCluster for boosting developer productivity and assess its architectural quality attributes from a DNA sequencing task context end-to-end processing perspective.

## Introduction
The rapid rise of large scale AI — whether in natural language models or computer vision — hinges on turning raw knowledge (text, images, video) into dense numeric arrays (embeddings) that downstream algorithms can process efficiently. Tokenization and embedding pipelines must handle terabytes — or even petabytes — of data, extract meaningful features, and expose them as vectors for similarity search, graph traversal, or predictive modeling. Traditional frameworks like Apache Spark often fall short at this scale, driving demand for natively distributed, heterogeneous-aware solutions.

## Objectives
- 1. Design and evaluate Ray as a modular orchestration layer for scalable ETL and ML (Machine Learning) pipelines on AWS, including autoscaling EC2 to feed an HPC cluster with MPI (Message Passing Interface) application via Slurm (HPC job scheduler) leveraging AWS ParallelCluster.

- 2. Develop end-to-end application for data transfer - leveraging S3/FSx-Lustre -, preprocessing with encoding-decoding (Ray tasks) to fee HPC for a task in a DNA simulation algorithm context.

- 3. Benchmark heterogeneous application pipeline and hardware for an architecture trade-off analysis.


## Context and Motivation
Modern CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Array) each offer unique “sweet spots” in performance and efficiency, but leveraging them requires a flexible, cloud-agnostic orchestration framework. Ray’s lightweight task/actor abstractions and deep AWS integration provide that flexibility—simplifying CI-CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery), IaC (Infrastructure as Code), and hybrid HPC workloads. By streamlining data preparation (ingestion, sharding, transformation) and offloading compute to specialized architectures, this work aims to demonstrate a highly interoperable, scalable pipeline that delivers both performance and economic efficiency for next-generation AI workloads in the loop feedback with HPC purpose applications.
