# Ray in high-performance computing

In Transformer inference, input text is first broken into discrete numerical tokens, but these tokens aren’t used directly; they’re immediately transformed into learned “embeddings,” which are dense vectors capturing each token’s semantic and contextual information. During training, the model learns an embedding weight matrix that maps each token to its high-dimensional representation via a simple matrix multiplication. To incorporate word order, fixed positional embeddings—vectors encoding each token’s position—are added to the resulting token embeddings. This two-step process of multiplying the token-to-embedding matrix and then summing positional embeddings yields the final input vectors the Transformer uses for all downstream attention and feed-forward computations [@spuler2024tokenizer].


A large vocabulary directly impacts the size of the embeddings matrix, which is a set of weights. For example, the number of distinct k-mers in DNA sequences can be 40 times greater than the number of distinct words in English Wikipedia, leading to huge lookup tables and significant memory/disk requirements to persist them on a computing node [@zhang2021lshve]

Despite sequencing advances that generate ∼1 billion reads (200–1 000 bp) per human genome (0.5–1 TB) in three days, analysts face three major computation challenges: (1) the flood of error‐prone reads must pass through 15–20 complex pipeline stages—from alignment (BWA, Bowtie [17, 14]) and data cleaning (Picard-Tools [28]) to variant calling (GATK [7])—to extract biologically meaningful variants; (2) most tools are designed for single-machine, often single-threaded execution, making them ill-suited for TB-scale inputs; and (3) end-to-end runtimes at centers like NYGC range from 3 to 23 days per sample [8], with specialized cancer-analysis steps (Mutect [5], Theta [25]) taking days or weeks—far exceeding the 1–2-day clinical turnaround required for precision medicine[@roy2017massively].

## Modular Architecture for Cloud HPC

Modularity is a cornerstone of efficient HPC on AWS. By decomposing pipelines into small, independently testable components—defined as code, container, or microservice—you minimize manual intervention and accelerate CI/CD. Infrastructure-as-code (CloudFormation, ParallelCluster) and automated testing ensure that each change is validated in isolation, preventing system-wide downtime.

### Ray Core & Ray AIR: Building Blocks

    Ray Core offers two primitives:

        Tasks (stateless functions), ideal for parallel data transforms

        Actors (stateful services), for pooling resources (e.g., caches, GPUs)

    Ray AIR unifies Ray Datasets (distributed I/O), Ray Train (distributed training), Ray Tune (HPO) and Ray Serve (model deployment) under a consistent API. Each library is “distributed by design,” so you can mix-and-match—for example, map a preprocessing task over S3 files, train embeddings in parallel, then serve feature transformers as microservices.

### Ray-Powered ETL for Feature Embeddings

In a typical ETL before HPC compute:

    Ingestion & Cleaning: Ray Datasets shards S3/FSx reads across workers, applies tokenization or format fixes.

    Feature Extraction: Stateless Ray tasks invoke pretrained AI models (e.g. protein‐language models, ResNet) to compute embeddings. GPU actors batch inferences for high throughput.

    Embedding Serialization: Results are written back to Parquet or HDF5 via parallel Ray Dataset writes, producing chunked numeric arrays ready for HPC solvers.

### Integrating Embeddings into HPC Compute

    Numeric Solvers (e.g. spectral solvers, graph algorithms) consume embeddings as input vectors or masks.

    Ray → Slurm Bridge: Lightweight Ray tasks submit jobs via SSH/Sbatch to a ParallelCluster, passing S3 paths to embedding files.

    This pattern lets Ray handle data-prep and model inference, while specialized MPI/GPU kernels run on HPC nodes.

### Synthetic Data Generation for CFD
Ray’s modularity shines in data augmentation:

    Deep Generative Models (StyleGAN, PDE-aware VAEs) run as Ray actors to produce synthetic flow fields or mesh deformations.

    On-the-fly Streaming: Generated images or volume grids are chunked and fed directly into CFD solvers (OpenFOAM, ANSYS) via Ray tasks, enabling rapid scenario exploration without manual data staging.

By leveraging Ray Core and AIR, there is the strategical benefit of a cloud-agnostic, fully modular ETL stack that bridges AI-driven feature engineering and HPC numerical simulation—boosting developer productivity, resource utilization, and end-to-end pipeline agility.
