## Abstract
The objectives of this study are integrate Ray ETL (Extract-Transform-Load)[2] stack that bridges AI-driven feature engineering with on-demand virtual HPC (High Performance Computing) provisioned with Amazon Web Services (AWS) ParallelCluster [7] for boosting developer productivity and assess its architectural quality attributes from a DNA sequencing task context end-to-end processing perspective.

## Introduction
The rapid rise of large scale AI — whether in natural language models or computer vision — hinges on turning raw knowledge (text, images, video) into dense numeric arrays (embeddings) that downstream algorithms can process efficiently. Tokenization and embedding pipelines must handle terabytes — or even petabytes — of data, extract meaningful features, and expose them as vectors for similarity search, graph traversal, or predictive modeling. Traditional frameworks like Apache Spark often fall short at this scale, driving demand for natively distributed, heterogeneous-aware solutions.

HPC — often called accelerated computing — unites CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs across clustered nodes to tackle simulations and analyses that single machines cannot handle, from drug‐discovery molecular dynamics to flight simulations and financial risk models. Traditional on-premises HPC demands massive capital investment, long procurement cycles, and manual hardware refreshes, while data-intensive workloads increasingly overwhelm local I/O, networking, and cooling infrastructures. Moving to the cloud addresses these limitations by providing virtually unlimited, on-demand capacity: teams can spin up thousands of GPU‐accelerated instances for minutes at a time, eliminate hardware maintenance, and run fine-grained benchmarks without overprovisioning. The IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code) - with AWS ParallelCluster and CloudFormation — plus CI-CD (Continuous Integration-Continuous Delivery) pipelines and EC2 Spot Instances (up to 90% cost savings) further automate deployments and optimize spend, all while maintaining security and compliance.

In life-science research, cloud HPC is already transformative. Novartis, for example, screened 10 million compounds against a cancer target on AWS in under nine hours for just \$4 232—a task that would have taken weeks and cost tens of millions on-premises [3]. Beyond genomics, FPGA‐accelerated Smith–Waterman alignments run up to 160× faster than CPUs, and SYstem-wide Compute Language (SYCL) enables C++ heterogeneous acceleration across GPUs and FPGAs. Even Apple’s M-series [22] SoCs now integrate CPUs, GPUs, matrix engines, and neural accelerators into a single chip for energy-efficient desktop HPC. AWS P4d instances allow researchers to launch clusters with over 4 000 A100 GPUs, petabit-scale networking, and FSx for Lustre shared storage, unleashing unprecedented parallel performance for both scientific simulations and deep-learning training [7].


## Context and Motivation

In modern scientific and engineering workflows, vast raw datasets must undergo a series of complex transformations — cleaning, normalization, format conversion, alignment, partitioning, and feature extraction — before they can drive high-fidelity numerical simulations. Tasks like trimming low-quality sequencing reads, converting FASTQ into indexed BAM files, sharding terabytes of molecular trajectories into NetCDF [21] chunks, or generating unstructured CFD meshes all demand a dynamic, distributed framework that can orchestrate heterogeneous compute across CPUs, GPUs, and even FPGAs.

Beyond AI-driven model training, we see this two-phased pattern in genomics (where billions of base-pair reads are error-corrected, aligned, and k-mer–vectorized)[13], molecular dynamics (where raw trajectory dumps are preprocessed into frame-wise inputs for GROMACS), and spectral analysis (where continuous signals are windowed, padded, and batched for FFT libraries), as can be seen the steps schema in the **Figure 3** as well as structured the steps in **Table 1**. Each domain shares unpredictable I/O patterns, irregular data formats, and compute kernels that stress both memory and network fabrics.

Ray’s lightweight tasks and actors, integrated with AWS services like S3, FSx for Lustre, and ParallelCluster, provide the elasticity and locality-aware scheduling these pipelines require. Whether you’re performing extreme-scale protein similarity searches with locality-sensitive hashing (LSHvec)[19], running live MD analysis on petabyte-scale outputs, or orchestrating mesh generation for CFD, a unified, cloud-agnostic control plane is essential. By streamlining “last-mile” ETL at Phase 1 and handing off compact, high-dimensional embeddings to Phase 2’s MPI/Slurm simulations, we unlock both developer agility and peak hardware performance [16] — enabling scientific insights at scales that traditional Big Data or monolithic HPC stacks simply cannot match.

By automating the entire data lifecycle — ingesting raw reads into S3 or FSx-Lustre, sharding, vectorizing and extracting embeddings from them with Ray, dispatching compute intensive simulations on ParallelCluster, and then feeding results back into downstream ML or analytics workflows — this proposal establishes an **iterative feedback loop**. This cyclical pattern ensures that insights from each phase continuously enrich the next, delivering a fully interoperable, scalable pipeline that maximizes both performance and cost efficiency for next generation AI driven and HPC powered applications.

## Objectives
- 1. Design and evaluate Ray as a modular orchestration layer based on Ray for ETL and ML (Machine Learning) pipelines on AWS, including autoscaling EC2 to feed an HPC cluster provisioned with AWS ParallelCluster.

- 2. Develop end-to-end application for data transfer based on S3 or FSx-Lustre, Ray tasks for preprocessing with encoding-decoding and feeding a virtual HPC cluster provisioned with AWS ParallelCluster in order to execute tasks within the context of a DNA simulation algorithm.

- 3. Benchmark heterogeneous application pipeline and hardware for an architecture trade-off analysis.
