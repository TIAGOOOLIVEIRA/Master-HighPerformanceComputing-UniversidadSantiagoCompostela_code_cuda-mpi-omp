## Introduction
The rapid rise of large-scale AI—whether in natural language models or computer vision—hinges on turning raw knowledge (text, images, video) into dense numeric arrays (embeddings) that downstream algorithms can process efficiently. Tokenization and embedding pipelines must handle terabytes—or even petabytes—of data, extract meaningful features, and expose them as vectors for similarity search, graph traversal, or predictive modeling. Traditional frameworks like Apache Spark often fall short at this scale, driving demand for natively distributed, heterogeneous-aware solutions.

## Objectives
- 1. Design and evaluate Ray as a modular orchestration layer for scalable ETL and ML pipelines on AWS, including autoscaling EC2 to feed an HPC cluster with MPI/Slurm (leveraging AWS ParallelCluster).

- 2. Develop end-to-end deployment patterns for data transfer (S3/FSx-Lustre), preprocessing with encoding-decoding (Ray tasks) and feeding HPC for task in a DNA simulation algorithm context (AWS ParallelCluster).

- 3. Benchmark heterogeneous application pipeline and hardware for an trade-off analysis.


## Context and Motivation
Modern CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs each offer unique “sweet spots” in performance and efficiency, but leveraging them requires a flexible, cloud-agnostic orchestration framework. Ray’s lightweight task/actor abstractions and deep AWS integration provide that flexibility—simplifying CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and hybrid HPC workloads. By streamlining data preparation (ingestion, sharding, transformation) and offloading compute to specialized architectures, this work aims to demonstrate a highly interoperable, scalable pipeline that delivers both performance and economic efficiency for next-generation AI workloads.
