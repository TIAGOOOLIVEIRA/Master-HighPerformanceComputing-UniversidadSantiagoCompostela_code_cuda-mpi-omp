Emerging Approaches

Cloud agnostic for Embeddings
Everything becomes array of numeric representation
It can sometimes overcome precision for regular feature engineering
Scientific workflow merged into Data transformation, AI (to enhance) ETL and Numeric simulation
Cloud tech-stack to speedup and simplify data logistic, automation
    no need for lockin
to extract embeddgins
What scientific tasks best fit and in the future
However LLM (market openai,..) can not easily generalize for all possible problems (scientific)
    so why a framework (distributed training, predicting, data transform distributed, accelerated gpu) can be key
    code snippet for dnabert_XX, LSHVec in Ray
    Run for real Ray tests
Data centric
    loop back...
Target solution ALGORITHM:
    emsembling between different devices for accelerantion: FPGA, GPU, CPU 
        there is no one size fits all
        comparing execution time of each task and chooses the platform where ti achieves lower KPI 
    collect metrics per execution
    leverages LLM for IaC automation to reduce hurdle of heterogeneous tech stack

    add code snippet for how to extract embeddings levering other LLMÂ´s
            tradeoff for onboarding market llm: latency, batch, scalability, cost

    HPC alternative: SageMaker leveraging AI

Does two phase provide execution and cost effectiveness across...?
Why does two-phased work effctivelly?
How can scientific workflow take advantage of the next emerging trend in cloud computing?

Benchmarking to compare: 
    performance of workflow, management system and schedulers
KPI, challenges: Scaling time, cold start time, IO time, time limit...
Hybrid execution strategy to find optimal execution platform
Design principle: take advantage of..

What are source of ineficiency when executing scientific workflows on traditional cluster:
    scientific workflows
scientific workflows (most modern capabilities): bring new trend: llm, agentic, 
    share projects I am involved: AWS, Azure

validate ParallelCluster building blocks (multi gpu, )
    Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA), Amazon FSx for Lustre, Kendra

CFD future work: to leverage Ray for genAI on creating synthetic data for CFD meshes
    mention trend of data centric
    mention my current job: Microsoft Discovery agentic AI for scientific workflow
