# 2nd Phase: Numeric Simulation with Cloud HPC

## 1. What Is HPC and Why It Matters

High-Performance Computing (HPC), often called accelerated computing, brings together the CPU, GPU, and FPGA power of many clustered nodes to tackle complex problems far beyond the reach of a single machine. This distributed approach is crucial for processing the vast volumes of data produced in fields such as drug discovery, flight simulation, and financial risk analysis, where each simulation or analysis may involve terabytes of inputs and sophisticated numerical algorithms.

## 2. Pitfalls of On-Premises HPC

Until recently, most organizations relied on on-premises HPC clusters—an approach that demands huge upfront capital outlays and lengthy procurement cycles. Maintaining and refreshing this specialized hardware over its lifecycle is a continual challenge, and forecasting annual budgets and capacity needs often proves inaccurate. Scaling is constrained by the availability of GPUs or other accelerators, which must be ordered, installed, and configured by hand. Traditional systems also emphasize raw floating-point performance, yet modern scientific workloads have grown increasingly data-intensive, straining I/O subsystems and network bandwidth. Large dataset transfers can swamp local networks, and on-site data centers struggle with the added demands on power, cooling, and backup.

## 3. Cloud-Native HPC Advantages

Shifting to the cloud overcomes these hurdles by offering effectively unlimited capacity and on-demand access to the latest compute, storage, and networking services. Teams can spin up thousands of GPU-accelerated instances—paying only for the minutes used—eliminating the need for hardware maintenance and long lead times. This elasticity not only drives rapid experimentation but also optimizes performance through fine-grained benchmarking and load testing. Automation with Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g. AWS ParallelCluster, CloudFormation) and continuous deployment patterns further amplifies operational efficiency. And by leveraging EC2 Spot Instances, organizations can reduce compute costs by up to 90% compared to on-demand pricing, all while ensuring data stays secure and compliant.

## 4. Science in the Cloud: A Genomics Example

Cloud HPC is revolutionizing life-science research. Sensitive genomic pipelines—once limited by local disk capacity and network bottlenecks—now scale effortlessly on Amazon S3 and DataSync, enabling secure, high-throughput access to massive sequence datasets. For instance, Novartis screened 10 million small molecules against a cancer target on AWS in under nine hours (costing just \$4 232), a task that would have required tens of millions of dollars and weeks of runtime on-premises [3].

## 5. Harnessing Heterogeneous Accelerators

Modern cloud platforms seamlessly combine multi-core CPUs with GPUs and FPGAs to accelerate specialized kernels. For example, FPGA implementations of Smith–Waterman alignment can run up to 160× faster than CPU code, while SYCL offers a unified C++ ecosystem for heterogeneous acceleration. Apple’s M-series SoCs further integrate CPUs, GPUs, matrix engines, and neural accelerators on a single chip—promising high memory bandwidth and energy efficiency for desktop-scale HPC workloads.

## 6. AWS-Provisioned Supercomputers

On AWS, P4d instances let you launch clusters with over 4 000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs connected by Petabit-scale networking, backed by Amazon FSx for Lustre for high-throughput shared storage. Developers build massively parallel applications using CUDA, unleashing unprecedented speed for both HPC simulations and deep-learning training [7].
