Computational Challenges in Highly-Scaled DNA Sequencing Unmet by Traditional Big Data and Storage Technologies

The rapid advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have led to an "explosion in the volume of data," transforming Bioinformatics into a computationally intensive discipline

This "tsunami of genomic data" presents several challenges that traditional Big Data and storage technologies often struggle to meet efficiently for highly-scaled processing:
- Massive Data Volumes: Genomic datasets are enormous, ranging from gigabases to terabases for single runs, with estimates predicting 2 to 40 exabytes of data within the next decade in genomics
- For instance, a single human genome sequence is about 3 billion base pairs long and takes approximately 200 GB of storage
- Prohibitively Long Execution Times: Existing methods and algorithms are often not well-prepared to handle such large amounts of genomic data efficiently, leading to "prohibitively long execution times"
- For example, assembling a human genome using a popular sequential program like Velvet needed at least 2 TB memory and several weeks
- Data Transfer and I/O Bottlenecks: Voluminous data can "consume all network bandwidth" and cause traffic issues during transfer
- Local data centers face constant struggles with data access, I/O, backup, power, and cooling. When hardware accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs) are used, data movement from a host processor to the accelerator card can "easily dominate execution times" and negate compute-time improvements
- Load Imbalance in Parallel Applications: Genomics applications often have "heterogeneous processing costs due to the variability of biological sequence sizes" and the use of iterative algorithms, which leads to load imbalance in parallel processing
- The slowest process determines the overall execution time

**High Computational Intensity: Analyzing genomic data requires "powerful computational and statistical methods"**

- Tasks like finding optimal local alignments (e.g., Smith-Waterman algorithm) are "computationally expensive" when searching large databases. Protein structure prediction (PSP) is a complex problem in computational biology
- Specialized Hardware Needs: While general-purpose processors are widely deployed, hardware accelerators like FPGAs and GPUs, despite their "demonstrated performance potential," are less frequently deployed in the field
- Storage Inefficiencies for Proteogenomics: Proteogenomic datasets generate massive data volumes, and traditional storage solutions are often inefficient, while specialized compression methods have limited scalability
- Operational and Logistical Complexity: Using traditional High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources on grids or clouds presents an additional layer of logistical and operational complexity, as federated grid systems may limit job submission to batch queues, requiring better algorithms for splitting and load balancing tasks

In a protein-sequencing context, data must be prepared the to upstream for simulation tasks. 

Embedding extraction: Ray tasks invokes the ML model ProtBERT on each frame or on static structures to compute residue embeddings—stored as (N_res × D) float arrays.

HPC integration: Stage these embedding arrays to S3/FSx, then submit gmx mdrun or custom MPI-accelerated analysis kernels on a ParallelCluster, passing embedding file URIs for co-analysis.

By treating each GROMACS input step as its own modular component—with clear parsing, transformation, cleaning, and serialization the workflow also benefits by:
    Automate reproducible pipelines (CI/CD for MD setups)
    Scale data prep via Ray’s parallel I/O and task scheduling
    Interoperate with HPC kernels that consume numeric embeddings rather than raw PDB text
