# Ray in high-performance computing

Data preprocessing for commong challenges in HPC

To elaborate statements on the challenges of handling huge amount of data to prepare before any further processing like simulation for CFD, Protein discovery, Molecule or Genomic purposes
Situation today

AAmazon Feature store vs LanceDB vs S3:Parquet for embeddings or genomic DNA sequencing
