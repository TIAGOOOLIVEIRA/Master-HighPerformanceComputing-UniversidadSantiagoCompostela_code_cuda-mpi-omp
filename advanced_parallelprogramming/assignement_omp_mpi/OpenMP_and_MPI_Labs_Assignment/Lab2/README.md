- Comparative Analysis: Blocking vs Nonblocking MPI

  __comparison based on the analysis in /Lab1/README.md "Labs1, Hybrid Programming; 1: pi_integral.c"__

| Feature                      | Blocking MPI Version         | Nonblocking MPI Version               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Best Time**                | 0.750 s (4Ã—4)                | 0.048685 s (16Ã—1)                     |
| **Best Speedup**             | 8.26Ã—                        | 127.37Ã—                               |
| **Synchronization Overhead** | Significant at 16Ã—1 (5.12Ã—)  | Drastically reduced in 16Ã—1 (127Ã—)    |
| **Hybrid Balance**           | 4Ã—4 had the best performance | All layouts perform similarly well    |
| **MPI-only Scalability**     | Poor (due to blocking sync)  | Excellent (nonblocking hides latency) |


### Conclusions
- Nonblocking collectives (e.g., MPI_Ireduce + MPI_Wait) dramatically reduce communication stalls, particularly in pure MPI (no threads) scenarios.

- In the blocking version, 16Ã—1 suffered from heavy synchronization and lack of intra-node threading.

- With nonblocking, 16Ã—1 became the fastest configuration, indicating that latency was effectively hidden and collective progress overlapped with computation or other processes.

- Hybrid configurations (4Ã—4, 8Ã—2) still perform excellently â€” nonblocking collectives provide more consistently high efficiency across layouts.
