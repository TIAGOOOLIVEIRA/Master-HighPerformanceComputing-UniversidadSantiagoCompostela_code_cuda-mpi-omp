# Optimizing Vector Algorithm Processing through the integration of Ray IO and HPC in the Cloud


The demand for tokenizing the knowledge to allow AI models like LLM or Computer Vision algorithms to perform tasks for bringing insigths reasoning on complex and  to process the data as arrays of numeric representation… what can enable acceleration of the computation by leveraging CPU acceleration technologies like AVX (...), GPU (...) or even FPGA … precision.. Accuracy… economic efficiency

….This master thesis aims to explore the benefit of high interoperability and scalability… where Ray fits well for pre-processing and applies encoding-decoding algorithms on large datasets the to hand it over to the proper device architecture (gpu, cpu, fpga, macos)... vector algorithms to tackle graphs, encryption, similarities models…
